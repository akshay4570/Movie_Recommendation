# Movie_Recommendation
This is a Movie Recommendation Engine which we have developed as a part of Project Submitted for our DataMining Event.
This was a Group event and the credit for this project also is shared by 3 others.
The project is built to extract features from the provided Datasets and to check the Trendsd in which people are interested in watching movies,the sole Aim of the project was to implement Apriori Algorithm which is an Association learning Algorithm.
The Algorithm part is entirely hardcoded based on the Algorithm which is Available in any Website or is also available in the Document provided by me.
There were also many missing Data values and a lot of Preprocessing is involved before applying the Algorithm,these are the various steps involved in Data Preprocessing namely:
1)Data Reduction
2)Data Integration
3)Data Cleaning
4)Data Transformation

After Performing the above activities we have Applied the Algorithm.
The main Difficulty faced here was converting the actual string as the Apriori Algorithm applied only for characters and we combine the characters to form a new rule,but the names of the movies are variable strings so we encoded them to form a six digit number(as numbers are easier to process than strings).

Then we applied the Algorithm.
Got the Association Rules
Performed Recommendation.
